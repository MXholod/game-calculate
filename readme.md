### Want to test your calculation skills?

This is a game where you can practice simple mathematical calculations such as __addition__, __subtraction__, __division__, and __multiplication__. Your result is compared with the correct one at the end of each level. There're 10 levels with limited time for each level.
The goal of this game is not to show the user that the game is much smarter than the user, but rather to help the user improve their skills. Therefore, before starting each level, the user is allowed to choose the range of numbers, the signs of the numbers, type of numbers such as 'even', 'odd' or 'mixed' and so on.

This game has a statistics page with a pagination on it. This page displays results that can be sorted by date, successfully completed levels, and time remaining. There's a button on this page that cleans all the statistics data.

___The technology stack used in the game:___
+ Gulp (task runner)
+ Pug (a popular templating engine)
+ SASS (CSS preprocessor)
+ Typescript
+ Jest (framework for JS testing)
